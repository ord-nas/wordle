* Better estimate of expected moves given word set size.
  * Can start with MaxEntropy, get empirical data.
  * Repeated until reaching a fixed point.
* Probabilistic?
* Tree search, starting when set size is small emough?
  * Maybe to get a feel for if this will be useful or not, hammer on a single word and fuzz the guesses and see if we can do better than the best entropy guess.
* Correctly recognize that getting the word right is good actually! E.g.:

Words left: 2 {rebut, robot}
For guess aaron, there are 2 responses.
For guess aaron, potential reponses are: {aaron => (robot), aaron => (rebut)}
aaron
Words left: 1 {robot}
robot

Okay fine, but why didn't you guess one of robot or rebut instead of aaron? That would have narrowed it down the same way but you have a 50% chance of getting it on the first try!
